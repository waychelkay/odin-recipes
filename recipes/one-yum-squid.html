<h3> Description</h3>
<p> When cooking squid, the golden rule is to cook it fast (like this method, shared by Irish chef Clodagh McKenna from her new book, In Minutes) or cook it slow. Otherwise, it can turn out too chewy. Paired with spicy chorizo, earthy chickpeas, peppery kale and crunchy almonds, this dish feels like an instant taste-escape to Spain.

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 ounces Spanish-style chorizo (see Tip), sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled  </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>18 ounces squid, cleaned and cut into 1/2-inch rings, tentacles halved </li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed</li>
        <li>4 cups coarsely chopped stemmed kale  </li>
        <li>⅓ cup sliced almonds, toasted </li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish   </li>
    </ul>
