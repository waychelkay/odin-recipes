<h3> Description</h3>
<p> Steamed eggs is a popular method for cooking eggs in Chinese cuisine. Eggs are whisked with chicken broth and steamed until cooked, creating a creamy, savory custard. When made correctly, the egg texture is extremely light, delicate and silky.

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>large eggs</li>
        <li>6 oz chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 green scallion thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add eggs and broth. Beat with a whisk until smooth. Pour egg mixture through a strainer and into another bowl. If there are any bubbles on the surface, deflate them.</li>
        <li>Wrap foil tightly over your bowl, so that no moisture from the Instant Pot can drop onto the egg batter.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of water to your Instant Pot (keep in mind some models of the Instant Pot may require more or less water to get it started). Place trivet inside and place your bowl on top of the trivet. </li>
        <li>Seal Instant Pot. Set to low pressure and cook for 6 minutes. Allow Instant Pot to do a natural release.</li>
        <li>Once the release is finished, remove lid. Remove foil from bowl. Drizzle egg with sesame oil and finish with scallions. Serve while egg is still hot.</li>
